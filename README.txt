I have a make file included so to compile use the make command

then to run the program use the command:

    ./sentiment trainingSet.txt testSet.txt > results.txt

After running this command there will be the preprocessed files, stripped files, and the
results file. The stripped files were used to make my reading of the data easier to read
and debug.
